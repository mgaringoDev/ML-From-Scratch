# ML-From-Scratch
This is just my repo for learning purposes in developing different types of ML algorithms from scratch to get a better understanding of how they work.

## NeuralNet
1. 3 Layer ANN from scratch no tool boxes
   * Mathematical derivation of a 3 layer ANN using tanh and softmax activation functions with a negative log likelihood cost function. 
   * Coding the mathematical derivations.
