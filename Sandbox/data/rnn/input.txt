You make me feel funny
When you come around
Yeah that's what I found out honey
What am I doing without you?
You make me feel happy
When I leave you behind
It plays on my mind now honey
What am I doing without you?
Oh, took for granted everything we had
As if I'd find someone
Who's just like you
Oh, we got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I'll let you in where no one else goes
What am I doing without you?
And all the things I've been looking for
Have always been here outside my door
And all of the time I'm looking for something new
What am I doing without you?
What am I doing without you?
Well I guess I'm ready
For settling down
And fooling around is over
And I swear it's true
No buts or maybes (buts or maybes)
When I'm falling down
There's always someone who saves me
And girl it's you
Oh, funny how life can be so surprising
I'm just realising what you do
Oh, we got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I'll let you in where no one else goes
What am I doing without you?
And all the things I've been looking for
Have always been here outside my door
And all of the time I'm looking for something new
What am I doing without you?
Well it's feeling right now
So let's do it right now
Praying that some how
You will understand the way
It's feeling right now (feeling right now) 
Baby somehow I won't let this slip away
Oh, 'cause we got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I'll let you in where no one else goes
What am I doing without you?
We've got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I'll let you in where no one else goes
What am I doing without you?
And all of the things I've been looking for
Have always been here outside my door
And all of the time I'm looking for something new (world of our own)
We've got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I'll let you in where no one else goes
And all of the things I've been looking for
Have always been here outside my door
And all of the time I'm looking for something new (world of our own)
We've got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I'll let you in where no one else goes (world of our own)
And all of the things I've been looking for
Have always been here outside my door
And all of the time I'm looking for something new
What am I doing without you?
I'm only human
Sometimes I make mistakes
If you forgive me
I'm gonna do what it takes
But now I know better
To hurt you was wrong
Girl it's with you I belong
Somebody needs you like never before
Somebody wants your love
Baby open the door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you turn out the light
Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you tonight
I've been thinking
We should be talking it through
You must believe me
I'll make it all up to you
Cause now I know better
To hurt you was wrong
Girl it's with you I belong
Somebody needs you like never before
Somebody wants your love
Baby open the door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you turn out the light
Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you tonight
In the dark
When there's no one else around
I still pray
That our love can be found
Somebody needs you like never before
Somebody wants you
Baby open the door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you turn out the light
Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Somebody needs you like never before
Somebody wants your love
Baby open the door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you turn out the light
Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you tonight
Mom always said, nothing would break me or lead me astray
Who would have guessed I'd let my mind drift so far away
You always said I was a dreamer now instead
I'm dreaming of things that's making my mind go crazy
Small things like
When I call you at home and he answers the phone
Or I get your machine and I don't hear me
When I lie in my bed with the thoughts in my head
When we danced and we sang and we laughed all night
Ooh da bop bop baby please don't let me go
Can't live my life this way
Ooh da bop bop baby please just let me know
And put my mind at ease for sure
On a love train
20 odd years now
I got off today
But nobody said the stop that I've taken
Was a stop too late
Now I'm alone I'm thinking of stupid
Hurtful small things like
When I call you at home and he answers the phone
Or I get your machine and I don't hear me
When I lie in my bed with the thoughts in my head
When we danced and we sang and we laughed all night
Ooh da bop bop baby please don't let me go
Can't live my life this way
Ooh da bop bop baby please just let me know
And put my mind at ease for sure
Maybe it's time to say goodbye
Maybe it's time to let this lie
This is when we must set things right
Now that we've gone our separate ways
I just can't live these desperate days
This is what I've been trying to say
Ooh da bop bop baby please don't let me go
Can't live my life this way
Ooh da bop bop baby please just let me know
And put my mind at ease for sure
