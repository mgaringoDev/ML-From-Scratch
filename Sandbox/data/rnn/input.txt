You make me feel funny
When you come around
Yeah that's what I found out honey
What am I doing without you?
You make me feel happy
When I leave you behind
It plays on my mind now honey
What am I doing without you?
Oh, took for granted everything we had
As if I'd find someone
Who's just like you
Oh, we got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I'll let you in where no one else goes
What am I doing without you?
And all the things I've been looking for
Have always been here outside my door
And all of the time I'm looking for something new
What am I doing without you?
What am I doing without you?
Well I guess I'm ready
For settling down
And fooling around is over
And I swear it's true
No buts or maybes (buts or maybes)
When I'm falling down
There's always someone who saves me
And girl it's you
Oh, funny how life can be so surprising
I'm just realising what you do
Oh, we got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I'll let you in where no one else goes
What am I doing without you?
And all the things I've been looking for
Have always been here outside my door
And all of the time I'm looking for something new
What am I doing without you?
Well it's feeling right now
So let's do it right now
Praying that some how
You will understand the way
It's feeling right now (feeling right now) 
Baby somehow I won't let this slip away
Oh, 'cause we got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I'll let you in where no one else goes
What am I doing without you?
We've got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I'll let you in where no one else goes
What am I doing without you?
And all of the things I've been looking for
Have always been here outside my door
And all of the time I'm looking for something new (world of our own)
We've got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I'll let you in where no one else goes
And all of the things I've been looking for
Have always been here outside my door
And all of the time I'm looking for something new (world of our own)
We've got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I'll let you in where no one else goes (world of our own)
And all of the things I've been looking for
Have always been here outside my door
And all of the time I'm looking for something new
What am I doing without you?
